1- Project Proposal

In this project, I will be focusing I plan to analyze the global corcollestl cancer dataset, having 21 parameters and over 160000 records. Since analyzing this sort of huge data will require high computational performance and power, I plan to use a random parts that in total containing 20000 records. I plan to augment the data with 2 other parameters which are age distribution score which I calculated from a data of UN and I will use this score and assign them to corresponding age groups to enhance the prediction performance of my machine learning algorithm. Also, I plan to add the ASR scores based on countries which represent the death ratios caused by this cancer in 100000 people. By doing this, country based prediction will be more powerfull and it will help ML algorithm to understand the impact of countries on survival.
